1. description of what happened in this A/B test
	Fitness: To Test or Not To Test?
	In this A/B test, 
	- Group A took a fitness test with a personal trainer, 
		and then fills out an application
	- Group B skips the test, and just fills out the application
	The Question: DOES THE FITNESS TEST INTIMIDATE PROSPECTIVE MEMBERS?

2. - summary of your dataset 
	- any helpful background information 
	> three datasets were created for this test:
		- all visitors
		- visitors who picked up an application
		- visitors who took the fitness test
		> visitors are randomly assigned to Group A or B
	A LOOK AT THE DATA UTILIZED FOR THIS A-B TEST

	
	
	
3. - results of the three hypothesis tests
	- including an explanation of the type of test that you used
	- why it was appropriate

	A. WHICH GROUP HAD MORE VISITORS APPLY FOR MEMBERSHIP?
		13% of B vs 9% of A -- a significant difference
		0.001 < 0.05 --> IS a significant difference --> 99.9% confident
		Used Chi Square Test b/c we were comparing 2 categories of data 
			from an A-B test.
			(Those who took the fitness test v.s. those who did not.)
	B. WHICH GROUP HAD MORE APPLICANTS BECOME MEMBERS?
		80% of A vs 77% of B (with application) --> <56.7% confident
		0.433 > 0.05 --> cannot be certain this is not merely chance
			-- but this is likely a product of chance
	C. OF ALL VISITORS, WHICH GROUP PRODUCED MORE MEMBERS?
		10% of B vs 8% of A -- a significant difference
		0.015 < 0.05 --> 98.5% confident in result
		
		
4. SUMMARY OF QUALITATIVE DATA

"I always wanted to work out... After taking the fitness test, I had to sign up and keep coming back...."
- Cora, 23

"...I wasnâ€™t accosted by any personal trainers trying to sell me some mumbo jumbo, which I really appreciated. I still ended up not signing up ... because the weight machines had all those sweat stains on them...."
- Jesse, 35

"I took the MuscleHub fitness test because my coworker Laura recommended it. Regretted it."
- Sonny, 26

"I tried to sign up for LiftCity last year, but the fitness test was way too intense. This is my first gym membership EVER, and MuscleHub made me feel welcome."
- Shirley, 22




5. A RECOMMENDATION FOR MUSCLEHUB
	Although Group A applications debatably resulted in more memberships,
	more Group B visitors applied for, and ultimately became, members.
	We recommend that the Fitness Test be dropped from the mandatory 
	pre-application process. (It might be useful to offer it to visitors 
	AFTER they apply, however.)
